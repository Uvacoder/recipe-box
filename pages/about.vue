        <p>
          I kicked off this blog for myself, really, to hold some of the things
          I was cooking and make sure I didn't forget what I did. Anyone is
          welcome to use these recipes though.

          You may notice that I bring up fresh ingredients a lot- you'll find
          that the difference between a good and a poor outcome with these in
          particular because they rely so heavily on vegetables, herbs, and
          spices.
