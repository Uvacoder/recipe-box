## Ingredients

### Chimichurri

- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1/2 cup chopped flat parsley
- 6 cloves garlic , chopped
- 2 small red chilies
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp coarse salt
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Steak

- Top Sirloin steak
- 1 tsp Garlic powder
- Dash of sugar
- Dash of red wine
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tbsp butter

## Instructions

### For the Chimichurri

- Mix all ingredients in a bowl and let sit 5 minutes.
- Then place in a blender and puree. You may have best luck if you make sure to coat the bottom of the blender in some of the vinegar so it can pick up the parsley easily.

### For the Steak

- Put seasonings and butter in a soue vide bag, cook to desired level of inside temp, based on thickness.
- If you don't have a soue vide, get one. Just kidding, you can broil it, aiming for a baseline internal temp of 155 degrees.
- For both methods, pull the steak out and pan sear the steak in the butter until the steak is golden brown on both sides. DO NOT flip it multiple times or push on it while it's cooking. Only flip once.

Top the steak with the chimichurri and serve.
