## Ingredients

### **Crab Cakes**

- 1 lb crab meat
- 1 large egg
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 1 tsp mustard
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 2 tbsp minced scallions, white and light green parts
- 1/4 cup fresh breadcrumbs
- 4 tbsp vegetable oil

### **Roasted Red Pepper Sauce**

- 3 tbsp heavy cream
- 1/2 cup greek yogurt
- 2 roasted red peppers
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/4 tsp cayenne

## Instructions

- If the crab meat is watery, line a fine mesh strainer with paper towels, fill it with the crab, and let it drain. Pat the crab meat dry.
- Mix the egg, mayo, mustard, paprika, and scallions. Add the crab meat and the breadcrumbs and gently combine. Chill for 2-8 hours.
- Divide the crab meat mixture into 8 parts. Shape each into a cake and lightly dredge with flour. The crab cakes will be soft, so handle them gently. Place each dredged cake onto a plate to rest while the oil heats.
- Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully slide the crab cakes into the skillet. Cook for 3-4 minutes per side, or until the cakes are crispy and golden brown. Remove the cakes to a paper towel lined plate.

### The Sauce

- The sauce can be made any time while the crab meat mixture is resting. Have the sauce ready before cooking the crab cakes.
- Bring the cream, yogurt, roasted red peppers, and garlic to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Simmer for 7-8 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes. Then pour the cream mixture into a blender; add the paprika, smoked paprika, and cayenne. Puree until smooth. Set the sauce aside until the crab cakes are done.
