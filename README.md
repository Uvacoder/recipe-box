# Recipe Box for The Healthy Dev

This is a recipe blog site set up in part to demonstrate some newer features of Nuxt:

- Nuxt Content
- Nuxt Image
- Nuxt Components (automatic import)

I kicked off this blog for myself, really, to hold some of the things I was cooking and make sure I didn't forget what I did. I'm not a chef and I have no formal training other than my grandma yelling "you can put more in, but you can't take anything out" at me from a young age. I'm Sarah Drasner, and most folks know me from my software engineering work. Anyone is welcome to use these recipes, I hope you enjoy them.

You may notice that I bring up fresh ingredients a lot- you'll find that the difference between a good and a poor outcome with these in particular because they rely so heavily on vegetables, herbs, and spices.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
