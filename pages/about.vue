        <p>
          I kicked off this blog for myself, really, to hold some of the things
          I was cooking and make sure I didn't forget what I did. I'm not a chef
          and I have no formal training other than my grandma yelling "you can
          put more in, but you can't take anything out" at me from a young age.
          I'm
          <a href="https://twitter.com/sarah_edo" target="_blank"
            >Sarah Drasner</a
          >, and most folks know me from my software engineering work. Anyone is
          welcome to use these recipes, I hope you enjoy them.

          particular because they rely so heavily on vegetables, herbs, and
          spices.
